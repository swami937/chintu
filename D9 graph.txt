⚙️ Class: Graph

Stores flight connections using an adjacency matrix
and checks connectivity using Depth First Search (DFS).

🧱 Data Members

n → number of cities (vertices)

adj[MAX][MAX] → adjacency matrix (shows flight between cities)

visited[MAX] → marks visited cities during DFS

🔧 Functions
1. create()

Takes number of cities n.

Fills adjacency matrix with 0 (no flight) or cost (flight exists).

2. display()

Prints the adjacency matrix in table form.

3. DFS(int v)

Visits a city v and recursively visits all connected cities.

Marks visited nodes to avoid repetition.

4. checkConnected()

Resets all visited flags to 0.

Starts DFS from the first city (index 0).

After DFS, checks if all cities were visited:

✅ If yes → Graph is Connected

❌ If not → Graph is Not Connected

🖥️ Main Function

Creates graph (enter cities & flight connections).

Displays adjacency matrix.

Checks and prints whether the graph is connected.
