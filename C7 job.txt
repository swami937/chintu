⚙️ Class: JobQueue

It stores jobs in an array and allows:

Add a Job

Delete a Job

Display all Jobs

🧱 Data Members

front, rear → indices for queue start and end

jobs[MAX] → array (max 10 jobs)

🔧 Functions
1. addJob(string job)

Checks if the queue is full.

If not full → adds job at rear + 1.

If first job → initializes front = 0.

2. deleteJob()

Checks if queue is empty.

If not empty → removes the job at front (oldest job).

Moves front to next position.

3. display()

Prints all jobs from front to rear.

Shows message if queue is empty.

🖥️ Main Function

Menu-driven:
1️⃣ Add Job
2️⃣ Delete Job
3️⃣ Display Queue
4️⃣ Exit

Runs in a loop until user chooses Exit.
